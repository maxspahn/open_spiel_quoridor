"""Tabular Q-Learner example on Tic Tac Toe.

Two Q-Learning agents are trained by playing against each other. Then, the game
can be played against the agents from the command line.

After about 10**5 training episodes, the agents reach a good policy: win rate
against random opponents is around 99% for player 0 and 92% for player 1.
